**Building Generative AI-Powered Applications with Python - Practice Projects**

Welcome to my collection of practice projects completed as part of the Building Generative AI-Powered Applications with Python course on Coursera. These projects focus on building generative AI applications using Python, with a special emphasis on using cutting-edge models and frameworks.

**About This Repository**

This repository contains a series of Python-based practice projects that I completed as part of my coursework in Building Generative AI-Powered Applications with Python on Coursera. The projects cover key concepts in generative AI, such as building models that can generate text, images, and other data types.

The projects followed a structured curriculum and were based on step-by-step tutorials, where I learned how to implement various generative models.

The projects were all made on IBM Skills Network Labs, which is a virtual lab environment. So some of these projects might not fully work unless changed.

**Practice Project 1: Give Meaningful Names to Your Photos with AI**

**Description:**

In this project, I built an image captioning tool using the BLIP model (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pretraining) from Hugging Face’s Transformers library. The model generates captions for images by understanding both the visual content and contextual relationships within the image. I used Gradio to create a simple, user-friendly web interface that allows users to upload images and receive automatic captions.

**Learning Outcomes:**

- Learn how the BLIP model combines vision and language to generate meaningful captions for images.

- Use Hugging Face’s Transformers library to easily integrate pre-trained models into an application.

- Implement a user interface with Gradio, making it simple for non-technical users to interact with the AI model.

**Key Features:**

- Upload an image to the app.

- Automatically generate a caption describing the image.

- Interactive interface powered by Gradio for easy deployment.

**Technologies Used**

Programming Language: Python

Libraries/Frameworks:

- Hugging Face Transformers: For accessing pre-trained BLIP model.

- Gradio: For creating an interactive web interface to interact with the model.

- PIL (Python Imaging Library): For handling image processing.

- Torch: For running the deep learning model.

- NumPy: For numerical operations and data handling.

- Matplotlib: For displaying images (optional, if required for visualization).

- Requests: For making HTTP requests to fetch webpage content and images.

- BeautifulSoup: For parsing HTML content and extracting image URLs.

**A Note on the Project**

This project uses BLIP, a transformer-based model that combines vision and language understanding, to generate captions for uploaded images. It is designed to show how generative AI models can be applied to real-world tasks like image captioning.
The application is built using Gradio, a powerful library that simplifies the process of creating interactive, user-friendly web interfaces for AI models. This project serves as a practical example of how AI can be deployed and made accessible to end-users.

**Practice Project 2: Build Your Own Chatbot Web App with GPT-3.5**

**Description:**

In this project, I built an AI-powered chatbot web application using OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 model integrated with Streamlit. The app allows users to interact with a generative AI model in a conversational format. By leveraging the OpenAI API, the chatbot generates intelligent and context-aware responses to user input. Streamlit provides a lightweight and intuitive web interface that makes the application both functional and easy to use.

**Learning Outcomes:**

- Understand how large language models like GPT-3.5 can be used to build conversational AI applications.

- Learn how to interact with the OpenAI API to send prompts and receive generated responses.

- Use Streamlit to design and deploy an interactive chatbot interface accessible through the browser.

**Key Features:**

-User input field to enter text queries.

- Automatically generates responses using GPT-3.5 based on the conversation history.

- Simple and interactive web UI using Streamlit for easy deployment and use.

- Maintains conversational memory to keep the chat coherent.

**Technologies Used**

Programming Language: Python

Libraries/Frameworks:

- OpenAI: To access and use the GPT-3.5 language model.

- Streamlit: For creating an interactive and real-time web-based chatbot interface.

- Python Built-in Libraries: For handling API keys, storing session state, and formatting responses.

**A Note on the Project**

This project demonstrates how to integrate a powerful language model into a real-time web interface, enabling users to engage with AI in a familiar chat-based format. It showcases the accessibility of generative AI technologies when paired with user-friendly frameworks like Streamlit. The chatbot is designed for quick prototyping and can be extended for use cases like customer support, virtual assistants, or educational tools. This project is a hands-on example of how conversational AI can be brought from concept to deployment with minimal overhead.
